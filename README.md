# Welcome to Dojo!

Dojo is the name of our habit tracker, where users can sign up and register an account with us! Users can then login into their account and start tracking their habits. Want to track how many laps you have done this week for swimming? You can! Or do you want to track you running habits in the month of July? You can now with Dojo!
